### Problem 1

The scree plot allows us to justify reducing the dimensionality of the data down to two dimensions. The scree plot shows that the first two components account for ~85% of the total variance; since these two components explain almost all of the variance in the data, it is appropriate to reduce the dataset down to these two dimensions.
